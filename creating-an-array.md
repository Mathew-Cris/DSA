## Creating an array in JavaScript.
First you you need to name a variable, lets name it  `myArray` using `const` keyword.
```js
const myArray;
```
We can also use an assignment operator to assign a value to it. Since we are creating an array we need to use square bracket `[]` then separate the
value using comma `,`
```js
const myArray = ["Hello", "World"];
```
Array in JavaScript can contain different kind such as, string, object, boolean and number.
```js
const myArray = ["String", new Date(), true, 25];
```
